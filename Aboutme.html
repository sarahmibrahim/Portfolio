    <p>Hello, I’m Sarah, I don’t really know what makes a good website but I know what I don’t like. I do remember a time before the internet and its fascinating to see how much it’s changed.
      <br> <p> I originally started to learn coding during the first lockdown, as a temp work was scarce as all office had to close and companies were just trying to work how their own staff could work from home. I thought learning a useful skill could help me in the long run. Learning with the Develope Acadmey, I have already improved 100% and hopefully will be good enough to find role in the future. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I currently temp in SHeffield but previously spent a decade working in the NHS in London before moving back up north as I wanted a change of career.
      I dont think I have learned enough web development to decide if I prefer front end or backend or full stack I'm just glad I know what those things mean.
    </p>
